    <b>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God
        the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures regarding his Son,
        who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David, 4 and who through the Spirit of holiness
        was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.
        Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes
        from faith for his nameâ€™s sake. And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ</b>.
        <hr>
        To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people:
        <hr>
        <i>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</i>
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Ave Christus</h2>

Graphic design has a lot of theory behind it, especially if one is specializing in UI/UX. You need to be very aware of who you're designing for, who your targeted audience is, how creative the expected standards are of your methods when generating art for the company you work for. Graphic design is visual communication, with an emphasis on problem solving. There is always a message, an audience, and a surrounding context.
The job and tasks as designers is to take all of this into account and to achieve those goals as best we can within the abilities and perimeters of the project.
The real specialization is in design fundamentals and theory, which is what should be built through educational studies such as university classes, or online certificates. Specialization beyond that simply comes from experience, from working within a specific area of design.
